# Elements examples

These are the Vaadin Elements demos implemented with [Scala](http://scala-lang.org) and [Scaladin](https://github.com/henrikerola/scaladin).

The project is built with [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/). After cloning the project you can say

    sbt container:start

to start it. After a while the app should be available at [localhost](http://localhost:8080).

Eclipse project files can be created with

    sbt eclipse

after which you can import the project to Eclipse. Note that you should have the [Scala IDE](http://scala-ide.org/) Eclipse plugin installed.
